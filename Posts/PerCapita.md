# Pollution in Indian Cities: The Per Capita story

In previous posts, we looked at pollution levels in major Indian cities from 2015-2020 and also looked at impact of COVID-19 on air pollution.
In this post, we will look at how much does one person contribute to air pollution in any particular city. Have a peek at [Pollution Description](https://github.com/algoasylum/ExploringTheUnseen/blob/master/Posts/Pollutants%20Description.md) for a detailed description of pollutants, their acceptable limits and health problems associated with them.

### Per capita
If the population of the city increase its pollution is bound to increase. We want to focus on the pollution footprints of the individual citizens living in these cities. To accomplish this we <b>divide the pollution levels by population of that city </b> to get the approximate pollution caused by one person. The population data was obtained from 2011 census.

### Pollution in 2019

Fig 1: PM2.5 levels for all cities.

Upper part of Fig 1 denotes the PM2.5 pollution levels for 2019 and per capita levels are shown in the bottom half. Delhi had arguably 
the highest pollution levels throughtout the year with high peaks during winter most likely due to crop burning in surrounding areas.
The per capita plot shows that even though Delhi had the highest levels the population adjusted/per head PM2.5 levels of Kolkata is much higher. This higher per-capita pollution levels of Kolkata might be due to other factors like factories/industries set up in this area or that a person living in Kolkata is contributing more towards pollution than in other cities. 

### PM<sub>10</sub> levels

Looking PM<sub>10</sub> levels Delhi again is the city with highest pollution levels. The per capita plots show that Kolkata again has overall greater per person pollution. Interestingly, Mumbai had relatively low levels of PM10 compared to other cities but when population is adjusted per capita pollution of Mumbai is almost on par with Delhi.

### 2020

The same trend hold true for 2020 as well: High levels of polltion in Delhi but the per capita levels are high for Kolkata and Mumbai.

### Conclusion
In this article we looked at pollution levels per capita and found that although cities like Delhi might high pollution levels, their per capita levels are lower than Kolkata and Mumbai. This suggests that a person living in Kolkata contributes more towards city's pollution than a person living in Delhi.
