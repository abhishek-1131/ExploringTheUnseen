# Details of Air Pollution 

This is not a post with any plots -- I just wanted to describe what the components of air pollution are, their sources, acceptable limits and interactions all in one place.

## WHO Guidelines

There are two authorities that specify the components of air pollution. The first is the World Health Organization, that publishes a
[factsheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health) on Ambient Air Pollution. This should be required reading for 
everyone who cares about how we live today! Another very useful article is
[Health Effects of Particulate Matter](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/189051/Health-effects-of-particulate-matter-final-Eng.pdf),
though this is focused on Europe. They identify five key air pollutants that pose health risks and the acceptable concentrations for the same. These are 
from 2005, we were supposed to get an updated list in 2020, but in the current scenario, don't hold your breath!

The guideline values are of various types: an annual mean, a 24 hour mean, an 8 hour mean, a 1 hour mean or a 10 minute mean. They are measured in units of micrograms per
cubic meter ($\mu g/m^3$). Typically, the difference  between the guidelines and actual values are pretty large, and it can be easy to just look at the gap and give up.
The WHO also publishes a few interic targets, to help  countries gradually move towards the final guidelines. 

Here's a summary:

## Indian Guidelines

The second reference we use is India's relaxed set of [guidelines](http://cpcbenvis.nic.in/airpollution/standard.htm) for these pollutants, which also adds a
few more pollutants to the mix (we only include Carbon Monoxide). Here are the Indian guidelines, with the WHO guidelines repeated for reference. Confusingly,
the guidelines are for different time periods, making it difficult to make reasonable comparisons.

    </tr>

## Other Considerations
It is important to note that these pollutants are inter-related. Particulate matter includes sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, etc. Ozone is
caused by the interaction of Nitrogen Oxides with other pollutants. And finally, health is effected by the combination of these pollutants, 
not only their individual presence. 

What is the impact of air pollution in India? I classify these along the following dimensions:
* Impact on physical health, including on growing children
* Impact on mental acuity
* Economic impact of lost working days due to health
* Economic impact of lost time due to traffic
* Mortality

## The Situation in India
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_India), "51% of air pollution is caused by industrial pollution, 27% by vehicles,
17% by crop burning and 5% by diwali fireworks." 21 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India, and 140 million people breath air that is more 
than 10 times the WHO safe limit.
